# Arithametic Operators
# a = 4
# b = 7
# c = 9
# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a**b)
# print(a//b)

# Assignment Operators
c = 12
x = 4-3 # assign 4-3 in a 
c += 3  # Increment value of b by 3 
c -= 3  # Decrement value of b by 3 
c *= 3
c /= 3

# Comparison Operators 
a = 4>2
a = 4<2
a = 5>=5
a = 4==4
a = 4!=4
